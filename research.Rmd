### Research Interests


<p> I am interested in the development and application of Bayesian Nonparametric models, especially for clustering, analysis of time series and for the modeling of network data. I am currently working on my first research project  under the supervision of professors <a href='http://www.micheleguindani.info/' target="_blank">Michele Guindani</a> and <a href='https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/' target="_blank">Erik Sudderth</a>, and I plan to advance to candidacy by Summer 2022. </p>

<p> Due to my varied background, I am enthusiastic about working with researchers in other fields. So far, I have collaborated with academic projects in the field of Behavioral Sciences (see below) but in the future I would love to contribute to projects in the fields of  Anthropology, Economics and Sociology. </p>
