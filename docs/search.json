I found myself enthusiastic of disparate disciplines that I studied along the path (e.g. philosophy, anthropology, contemporary sculpture - but also micro and macroeconomics, public law, game theory). At some point I understood I was best fit for a career in a quantitative field. And after finding Bayesian statistics, I understood that’s the direction I wanted to go.\n\n\n\n",
