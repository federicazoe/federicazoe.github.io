<p> I am a PhD candidate in <b> Statistics </b> at the University of California Irvine. I am jointly advised by <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/"> <b> Erik Sudderth </b> </a> and <a href ="https://www.micheleguindani.info/" > <b> Michele Guindani </b> </a>. My PhD research focuses on developing Bayesian models for the analysis of network and multivariate time-series data.  </p>


<p> I also work on projects in <b> statistics and data science education, </b> with <a href="https://www.minedogucu.com/"> Mine Dogucu </a> as my 'honorary advisor'. I created the R package <a href="https://federicazoe.github.io/gradetools/"> gradetools </a> to assist data science instructors with providing grades and feedback to their students. </p>
