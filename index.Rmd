<p> I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the <b> Department of Statistics </b> at the University of California Irvine. I am jointly advised by <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/"> <b> Erik Sudderth </b> </a> and <a href ="https://www.micheleguindani.info/" > <b> Michele Guindani </b> </a>. My PhD research focuses on  the development of Bayesian Nonparametric models for the analysis of network and multivariate time-series data.  </p>

<p> I have also been working on projects related to <b> statistics and data science education </b>, with <a href="https://www.minedogucu.com/"> Mine Dogucu </a> as my 'honorary advisor'. I have created the R package <a href="https://federicazoe.github.io/gradetools/"> gradetools </a> to assist data science teachers with grading and providing feedback to their students. </p>

<p> On my way to finding Statistics, I studied Economics with a focus on causal inference and microeconometrics. Before that, my roots were grounded in humanistic and social subjects: in my BSc, I learned about Anthropology, Sociology and Contemporary Arts, as well as Law, Accounting and Management. </p>

<p> There are many things I enjoy doing, among which hiking and traveling, playing board games and cooking. </p>
