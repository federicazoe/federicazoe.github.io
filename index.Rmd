<p> I am a third year PhD Student in the <b> Department of Statistics </b> at <a href = 'https://www.stat.uci.edu/' target="_blank"> <b> UC Irvine </b> </a>. </p>

<p> I am currently working on a dissertation proposal in Bayesian Nonparametrics, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/"> <b> Erik Sudderth </b> </a> and <a href ="https://www.micheleguindani.info/" > <b> Michele Guindani </b>. </a> </p>

<p> I am interested in applications of statistics to classification tasks, network analysis and recommendation systems. I also enjoy working on projects related to statistical education. </p> 

<p> I love learning about other cultures and traveling. </p>
