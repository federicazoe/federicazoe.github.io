<p style="margin:1"> I am a PhD candidate in <b> Statistics </b> at the University of California Irvine, jointly advised by <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/"> <b> Erik Sudderth </b> </a> and <a href ="https://www.micheleguindani.info/" > <b> Michele Guindani </b> </a>. My research focuses on developing Bayesian models for the analysis of networks and for clustering multivariate time-series data.  </p>


<p style="margin:0"> I also work on projects in <b> statistics and data science education, </b> with <a href="https://www.minedogucu.com/"> Mine Dogucu </a> as my 'honorary advisor'. I created the R package <a href="https://federicazoe.github.io/gradetools/"> gradetools </a> to assist data science instructors with providing grades and feedback to their students. I developed [an activity](https://federicazoe.github.io/bayes-games/) for teaching Bayesian modeling via gamification, teamwork and data collection. </p>

### News 

- August 2024. I am attending [JSM](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/index.cfm), where I am presenting on the [Bayes BATS](https://www.stat.uci.edu/bayes-bats/) program and participating in the [Preparing to Teach](https://preparingtoteach.org/) workshop.
