Hi there! Starting from August 2025 I will be an Assistant Professor of Statistics (tenure-track) at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Swarthmore College. I received my PhD in Statistics from UC Irvine, working with <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/" target="_blank"> Erik Sudderth </a> (UCI) and <a href ="https://www.micheleguindani.info/" target="_blank"> Michele Guindani </a> (UCLA). I combine Bayesian statistics and machine learning approaches to develop statistical models for structured data and scalable computational methods. I was supported with a fellowship of the <a href="https://hpi.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank"> HPI Research Center in Machine Learning and Data Science at UCI </a>.

I am very passionate about statistics and data science education. I work on a variety of teaching and research projects in this area, including on formative feedback to data science assignments, gamification, scientific writing and Bayesian thinking in STEM.

Outside of academia, I enjoy spending time in nature, playing board games and organizing road trips. 

My pronouns are she/her and this is how my name is pronounced:

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
html_tag_audio <- function(file, type = c("wav")) {
  type <- match.arg(type)
  htmltools::tags$audio(
    controls = "",
    style = 'width: 300px; height: 35px',
    htmltools::tags$source(
      src = file,
      type = glue::glue("audio/{type}", type = type)
    )
  )
}
html_tag_audio("files/index/pronounce-federica-zoe-ricci.m4a", type = "wav")
```
